## Overview

You can install Verrazzano in a single Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) cluster or an Oracle Linux Cloud Native Environment (OCLNE) deployment. For an Oracle OKE cluster, you have two DNS choices: xip.io or Oracle OCI DNS. Oracle Linux Cloud Native Environment currently supports only a manual DNS.

NOTE: You should install this alpha release of Verrazzano only in a cluster that can be safely deleted when your evaluation is complete.
